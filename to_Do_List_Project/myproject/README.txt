The name for this project is "ToDo List" chosen for its easy to remember name.

The project allows you to store your tasks or notes in the application. It is made to help the user by being able to write something down while it is fresh on their mind. Then later come back to it by being able to load their notes back into the web application.  

The web application does not require advanced hardware. All the user needs to use the web application is a device that supports browser function and has internet capabilities. 

Using the application is a matter of writing down whatever you want into the seven text boxes and hitting load to save and load the file to be viewed again.

To get support in case of any issues or bugs found in the software the developer can be found at Ivy Tech Community College or at work. The email for the developer is dcontreras3@ivytech.edu. 

Moving forward with the web application there are plans for a re-designed user interface with a log in and better functionality as far as saving information. There is plans for adding alarms and calendar events on mobile devices for better reminders. 

Thanks to my professor for help in the tight time constraints of the class. It would not have gotten done with my very limited experience programming and the short amount of time available in the classroom.
