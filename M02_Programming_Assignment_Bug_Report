Exercise 4.1 was not that difficult, I tried a couple times to get the logic correct. Once I figured it out there was no problems with the code running.
Exercise 4.2 was difficult in getting the logic correct. Once I used an if statement for the variables, I wrote another if statement using one of the two provided variables.
If the object was not one  the similar objects then it had to be to other like object.
Exercise 5.1 easily capitalized the word after seeing the replace method used in the textbook.
Exercise 5.2 was easily completed by grabbing the index of the tuple and matching it with the correct index of the answers variable.
Exercise 6.1 runs without problem if you sort through the list and use a variable to print the numbers. My own interpretation or overthinking made the code have 
logical errors at first.
Exercise 6.2 used a while loop comparing the number to the guess and telling the program to print said statements depending on the number. It was difficult writing the 
code to run without logical errors.
Exercise 6.3 borrowed the logic from the previous exercise. Once the logic is correct the code runs without problem.
